## Tutorial on Utilizing the Box R Package Effectively

This tutorial demonstrates how to incorporate the box R package into your data science workflow effectively 🖥️.

## Outline of this Tutorial

1.  What is box?

> \'box\' allows organising R code in a more modular way, via two mechanisms:
>
> 1.  It enables *writing modular code* by treating files and folders of R code as independent (potentially nested) modules, without requiring the user to wrap reusable code into packages.
>
> 2.  It provides a new syntax to import reusable code (both from packages and from modules) which is more powerful and less error-prone than **`library`** or **`require`**, by limiting the number of names that are made available.
